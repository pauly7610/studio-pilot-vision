# Studio Pilot Vision - Business Case One-Pager

## The Problem

**Regional Product Managers waste 40% of their time on manual status reporting instead of strategic work.**

### Current State Pain Points:

| Challenge | Impact | Cost |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Ad-hoc Status Requests** | 8 hours/week per PM compiling reports | $156K/year (50 PMs × $60/hr × 52 weeks) |
| **Late Risk Detection** | 30% of projects fail in late stages | $3.6M in sunk costs annually |
| **Unclear Blockers** | Delays blamed on wrong teams | 5 extra days per escalation |
| **Inconsistent Handovers** | Foundry-to-BAU takes 6 weeks | $720K in delayed revenue per product |
| **No Single Source of Truth** | Executives get conflicting data | Lost confidence, slower decisions |

**Total Annual Cost of Inefficiency: ~$8.2M**

## Risk Mitigation

### Implementation Risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Probability |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Low user adoption** | Phased rollout with executive sponsorship + training | Low |
| **Data quality issues** | Validation layer + data freshness indicators | Medium |
| **AI hallucinations** | Citation tracking + confidence scores + feedback loop | Low |
| **Integration complexity** | Start with Jira CSV, expand to live APIs incrementally | Medium |

### Success Factors

✅ **Executive Sponsorship** — VP Product as champion  
✅ **Pilot-First Approach** — APAC-Singapore (4 weeks) before global rollout  
✅ **Change Management** — 30-min training + in-app guidance  
✅ **Feedback Loop** — Weekly user reviews to iterate rapidly  
✅ **Quick Wins** — Show value in first 2 weeks (auto-escalation alerts)  

---

## Decision Framework

### Go / No-Go Criteria

**GO if:**
- ✅ Executive sponsor committed (VP Product or higher)
- ✅ 10+ PMs willing to participate in pilot
- ✅ Budget approved ($480K Year 1)
- ✅ Engineering resources available (4-person team for 8 weeks)

**NO-GO if:**
- ❌ No executive buy-in (will fail without top-down support)
- ❌ Data sources unavailable (need Jira/financial system access)
- ❌ Competing priorities (e.g., major platform migration underway)

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Pilot (Weeks 1-4)
- Deploy to APAC-Singapore region (12 products, 4 PMs)
- Measure: Weekly active users, time saved, escalation resolution time
- Success criteria: 80% WAU, 40% time savings

### Phase 2: Expand (Weeks 5-8)
- Roll out to North America + EMEA (30 products, 15 PMs)
- Measure: Ad-hoc status request reduction, NPS
- Success criteria: 50% reduction in status emails, NPS > 40

### Phase 3: Scale (Weeks 9-12)
- Global rollout (50+ products, 50+ PMs)
- Measure: Self-service adoption, portfolio health score
- Success criteria: 90% self-service, 85% data freshness
